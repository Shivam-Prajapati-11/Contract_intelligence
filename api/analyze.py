2. If a clause is present but contains redacted placeholders (like [**]), you must still extract the clause.
3. If a clause uses different terminology (e.g. 'assign' or 'transfer' for assignment, 'exclusivity' or 'proprietary' or 'ownership of data' for IP ownership, 'terminate... without cause' or 'terminate... upon notice' for termination for convenience), you must still extract it.{extra_guidelines}
4. Do not return NOT_FOUND if there is a clause that addresses the general topic of the question.
